# mailBag
A email client built using Typescript. The code written here follows Frank Zammetti's Full Stack Web Development book, but I fixed some bugs within it. Most notably:
- Not retreiving the entire mail list (takes too long)
- Lists items in reverse chronological order (Latest mail first). If you'd like to get that warm cringey feeling from reading things from many years ago, I could reverse the order again

This was done mostly as a way to get my feet wet with Typescript and fullstack web dev. I feel like I achieved this as I leveraged what I learned here to make more projects. Thanks Mr.Frank Zammetti.

Tbh, not a fan of the global state management with the state.tsx file. I feel that my 2 later projects, returnMe and and Chip420 made it easier to keep track of state of each component.
