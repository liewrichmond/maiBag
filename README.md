# mailBag
A email client built using Typescript. The code written here follows Frank Zammetti's Full Stack Web Development book, but I fixed some bugs within it. Most notably:
- Not retreiving the entire mail list (takes too long)
- Lists items in reverse chronological order (Latest mail first)

Tbh, not a fan of the global state management with the state.tsx file. I feel that my 2 later projects, returnMe and and Chip420 made it easier to keep track of state of each component.
